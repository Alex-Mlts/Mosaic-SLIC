# Mosaic-SLIC

Make an image into a mosaic form using the SLIC algorithm

An option to blur the image, as well as add edges to it has been added, but it's possible to activate / desactivate it only by editing the code directly.

(        mosaic = image2mosaic(img_path, num=num, compact=10, blur=False, edges=False, boundaries=True)        )
